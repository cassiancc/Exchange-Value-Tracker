Shows a sidebar containing inventory exchange values for each player in Craftmine.

Exchange Value Tracker requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

## Installation

1. Download Exchange Value Tracker from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/exchange-value-tracker/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Exchange-Value-Tracker/releases).
2. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

When this mod is installed, a sidebar will automatically appear when players are in a mine. As players fill up their inventory, the total exchange value of their items will be reflected in the sidebar. The sidebar also shows the base multiplier for the mine as well as which players have died.

When outside of a mine, the sidebar will be hidden.
